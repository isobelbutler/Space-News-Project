Then we broke up the project into its main components and divided the workload evenly, focusing on the following tasks:

- Implementing responsive website CSS.
- Designing the NASA APOD API fetch function with error handling.
- Designing The Guardian API fetch function with error handling.

## Compatibility
The website is designed to be compatible with modern web browsers. It utilizes CSS media queries to provide a responsive layout across different computer and mobile phone screen sizes.
